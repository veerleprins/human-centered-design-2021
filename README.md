## :black_nib: Description

For the Human Centered Design course in the minor Web Design & Development we learn to create an **exclusive design** with _exclusive design principles_ for a specific user. This particular user has a barrier that causes him / her to use the internet differently from someone without barrier.

**For the full process and how I came to the final version can be read in the [Wiki](https://github.com/veerleprins/human-centered-design-2021/wiki).**
